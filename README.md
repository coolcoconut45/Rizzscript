<p>To those new to github, please be aware that Rizzscript is free, <br>but has a license. This license allows you to use this code, but you must credit the author (me)<br>
  <var>and</var> make your project (or app or thing) open source. </p>
<p>As I am not finished, there is no way to use the Rizzscript language.</p>
